# Series on data tools for PhD research

## About
This repository contains tutorials, data, and code for getting up and running with [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) and [Python](http://www.python.org) and, two extremely powerful (and complementary) tools for data collection, management, manipulation, and analysis. Material is intended to complement presentations by [Russell J. Funk](http://www.russellfunk.org), given in the Strategic Management and Entrepreneurship PhD program workshop at the Carlson School of Management, [University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu), Fall, 2018. For questions, please contact me at [rfunk@umn.edu](mailto:rfunk@umn.edu).

These notes are intended to accompany workshop presentations and are not meant to fully stand alone.
