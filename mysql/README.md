## What is MySQL?
* MySQL is a __relational database__
* A relational database is a system for storing data that centers on __four key organizing structures__
 * __Rows__ store records or cases
     * Each row should be identified by a __unique key__ (or "primary" key)
 * __Columns__ store attributes or variables
 * A set of rows and columns together define a __table__
     * Within a database, each table should usually record data about distinct entity types (e.g., firms, people)
 * __Databases__ are collections of related tables

## Why should you use MySQL?
* Most people in our field tend to use tools like Stata or Excel for data management
* But Stata and Excel are not designed to be data management tools, and consequently, most researchers stretch them beyond their limits
 * This is increasingly true as projects using "big" data are becoming more common
* MySQL is designed from the ground up for data management, which gives it many advantages over other tools
  * Speed (access and manipulate data quickly)
  * Scale (manage projects with millions or billions of records)
  * Storage (keep one copy of your data, minimize possibility of errors, use only what you need)
* In addition, MySQL is designed to "play nicely" with many other data tools, which greatly extends its scope and power
  * For example, in the third session, we'll work on integrating MySQL and Python.
