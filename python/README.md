# Python

## What is Python?
* General purpose programming language
* Interpreted, not compiled
* Object oriented
* Named after Monty Python

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycKNt0MhTkk) is why you'll often see spam (the food) references in python code.

## Why should you use Python?
* General purpose programming language
* Helpful for nearly all aspects of the research process
  * Data collection (e.g., web scraping, web interfaces)
  * Data cleaning
  * Data processing (e.g., constructing variables) 
  * Data modeling (e.g., networks, machine learning)
  * Data visualization
* De facto language of the data science community
* __Massive__ user base means people are always writing awesome libraries and it's easy to get help
* It's also really easy to interface with other tools

## How do you do things with Python?

When it comes to writing and running programs in Python, you have a few different options.

* Write code in a text editor and run using `Terminal` (macOS) or `Command Prompt` (Windows) (this is the best general purpose approach).
* Write code directly in the python interpreter (this is most useful for quickly testing something or ver short programs)
* Write code in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (this is a great approach for data analysis, but can be clunky for other things).

Overall, there's no right or best way; just whatever is most comfortable and suits your needs.

Here are a few quick __examples__ that bring together some of these queries (and a few more)

## How do I get started?

No programming tutorial would be complete without a hello world program. Here's all you need in python. 

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Data types
One of the things that makes python so useful right out of the box are its native data types, so we're going to spend a while going through them. A few things to note. First, python uses ___dynamic typing__, meaning that variable types are not specifically declared and are instead inferred from the objects they represent.

```python
foo = 0
foo = "bar"
```

Compare that to the equivalent program in `C`, which uses ___static typing__:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int foo = 0;
   foo = "bar";
   return 0;
}
```
...in which the compiler get angry. 

# Strings, numbers

```python
"""numbers are pretty straightforward"""
foo = 3
bar = 4
baz = foo/bar # be careful if you run this in python 2
foo = 3.0
bar = 4.0
baz = foo/bar # gives you the result you expect

"""strings are awesome"""

# initialize
foo = "bar"

# multiline
foo = """this is my
multiline
string"""

# string to list
foo.splitlines()

# save as new single line string
foo_clean = " ".join(foo.splitlines())

# clean up strings
foo = "  I hate leading and trailing spaces    ".strip()
"People say I use too many exclamation points!!!".strip("!")
"133".zfill(5) # great for zipcodes
"55455".zfill(5) # great for zipcodes

# also great for cleaning and standardization
"hello world".upper()
"HeLlO wOrLd".lower()

""

```

# Lists

A `list` is an ordered set of elements, sometimes called, in other languages, an `array`. Note that lists are __ordered__, the significance of which will become clearer when we look at other data types.

```python
# initialize some lists
a = []
b = list()
a == b # prints True

# add some elements
a.append("foo")
a.append("bar")

# we can also add lists to list
[1,2,3].append([4,5,6])
[1,2,3].extend([4,5,6])

# we can access list elements using slice notation, which is very cool/useful
foo = "turning and turning in the widening gyre".split()
foo[0]
foo[1]
foo[-1]
foo[3:4]

# counting
foo.count("turning")

# sorting
foo.sort()
foo.sort(reverse=True)

# deleting
del foo[0]
```

There is a lot more that you can do with lists, most of which is a bit outside our scope today. But if you're curious, do some digging on `list` `comprehensions`.

```python
foo = "1, 2 buckle my shoe. 3, 4 shut the door."

# what if we want to remove all the numbers?
"".join([t for t in foo if not t.isdigit()])

```

# Tuples

Tuples are a lot like lists, but the are __immutable__, meaning that once you define one, it cannot be changed (unless you convert it to another data type).

```python
# initialize some tuples
a = tuple(range(0,100))
b = (1, 2, 'a', 'b')
```

# Dictionaries

One of the most powerful data types in python is the dictionary. It's literally a mini database. The key thing to remember about dictionaries is that they create a 1 to 1 mapping of keys to values. That means that you cannot repeat the same key more than once.

```python

d = {}
d["foo"] = 1
d["foo"] = 2
d["bar"] = "baz"

# we often want to make dictionaries of dictionaries
universities = {}
universities[0] = {"name": "University of Minnesota", "city": "Minneapolis", "students": 51147}
universities[1] = {"name": "University of Michigan", "city": "Ann Arbor", "students": 44718}

# iterate over
for id, data in universities.items():
  print(id, data["name"], data["city"], data["students"])

# we can access keys and values separately
universities.keys()
universities.values()

# create a dictionary of corporate abbreviations
ABBREVIATIONS = {"corporation": "Corp.",
                 "incorporated": "Inc."}

# now standardize some company names
company_names = ("Microsoft Corporation", "Yahoo Incorporated", "New York Times, Inc.")

for company_name in company_names:
  clean_name = []
  for token in company_name.split():
    if token.lower() in ABBREVIATIONS:
      clean_name.append(ABBREVIATIONS[token.lower()])
    else:
      clean_name.append(token)
  print(" ".join(clean_name))
```

# Sets

Sets are also useful, and can be extremely fast for some kinds of tasks. 

```python
# initialize
foo = {1,2,3,4,3,2}
bar = set([4,3,2])

# do some stuff
foo.intersection(bar)
bar.add(7)
foo.intersection(bar)
foo.discard(1)
foo.intersection(bar)

# sets are really useful for counting the number of unique items in a list
foo = [1,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,2,4,6,3]
print(len(foo))
print(len(set(foo)))
```

## Loops

If you have any experience with other programming languages, you've almost certainly encountered loops. Not too many surprises in python.

```python

# create a list to loop over
companies = ["Company A", "Company B", "Company Q", "Company Z"]

# for loop
for company in companies:
  print(company)
  
# we can also use slice notation
for i in range(0,len(companies)):
  print(i, companies[i])

# enumerate can be useful for giving things ids
for company_id, company in enumerate(companies):
  print(company_id, company)

# while loop
i = 0
while i < 100:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

## Functions

Details on functions are also a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial, but the basics are pretty straightforward.

Here is a function that computes a Jaccard coefficient, which measures the overlap between two sets, using some features of python's built in `set` data type:

```python
def jaccard(a, b):
  """Given two lists, a and b, return the jaccard coefficient."""
  s1 = set(a)
  s2 = set(b)
  intersection = s1.intersection(s2)
  union = s1.union(s2)
  return float(len(intersection)) / len(union)
```

```python
innovative_firms = ["C10","C24","C45","C12","C09","C12"]
profitable_firms = ["C34","C09","C45","C25","C45","C19","C04","C12"]
print(jaccard(innovative_firms, profitable_firms))

```


## Installing and loading packages
Although the python programming language comes with a lot of useful built in tools and functions, what really makes the language so useful are the many thousands of third party packages that you can download and use freely. Installation is done via the `pip` command (like `ssc` in Stata).

* `pip install numpy` (Numeric Python, matrix algebra and many other mathematical functions)
* `pip install scipy` (Scientific Python, even more mathematical functions)

Loading is easy:

```python
import numpy as np
np.mean([1,2,3])
```

## Bonusâ€”`geopy` package demonstration

Install the package from the Python Package Index (pypi):
* `pip install geopy`

```python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="phd_workshop")
location = geolocator.geocode("321 19th Ave S Minneapolis")
print(location.address)
print((location.latitude, location.longitude))
print(location.raw)
```
