# Python

## What is Python?
* General purpose programming language
* Interpreted, not compiled
* Object oriented
* Named after Monty Python

## Why should you use Python?
* General purpose programming language
* Helpful for nearly all aspects of the research process
  * Data collection (e.g., web scraping, web interfaces)
  * Data cleaning
  * Data processing (e.g., constructing variables) 
  * Data modeling (e.g., networks, machine learning)
  * Data visualization
* De facto language of the data science community
* __Massive__ user base means people are always writing awesome libraries and it's easy to get help

## How do you do things with Python?

When it comes to writing and running programs in Python, you have a few different options.

* Write code in a text editor and run using `Terminal` (macOS) or `Command Prompt` (Windows) (this is the best general purpose approach).
* Write code directly in the python interpreter (this is most useful for quickly testing something or ver short programs)
* Write code in [http://jupyter.org/](Jupyter Notebook) (this is a great approach for data analysis, but can be clunky for other things).

Overall, there's no right or best way; just whatever is most comfortable and suits your needs.

Here are a few quick __examples__ that bring together some of these queries (and a few more)

## How do I get started?

No programming tutorial would be complete without a hello world program. Here's all you need in python. 

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Data types
One of the things that makes python so useful right out of the box are its native data types, so we're going to spend a while going through them.

## Digging deeper

* For python questions, [http://stackoverflow.com/](Stack Overflow) is your friend
* [https://www.amazon.com/Python-Nutshell-Desktop-Quick-Reference/dp/144939292X/](Python in a Nutshell) and the [https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Third-David-Beazley/dp/1449340377/](Python Cookbook) are both good general references.
* [https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Python-Analyzing/dp/0596516495/](Natural Langauge Processing with Python) is getting a bit dated but is still an outstanding introduction to the practical sides of NLP.
* [https://www.amazon.com/Mining-Social-Web-Facebook-Instagram/dp/1491985046/](Mining the Social Web) is a nice overview of interacting with APIs using python, especially for social media sites.
